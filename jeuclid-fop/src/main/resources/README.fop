                              JEuclid FOP plug-in
                              -------------------
            
Installation

* Pre-requesites

  The JEuclid FOP plug-in is tightly integrated with FOP development, it will
  therefore only work with specific versions of FOP. For this version you need:
  
  * FOP 0.95beta or 0.95

* Actual installation

  Copy the these files into your fop's lib/ directory

  * jeuclid-core-x.x.x.jar 
  
  * jeuclid-fop-x.x.x.jar
  
  []

  If you have downloaded the full distribution, these files can be found in the 
  repo/ sub-directory.

  That's it! Enjoy MathML support in FOP.

Usage

* External MathML Documents

  External Documents may be referenced using \<fo:external-graphic\>. Both ODF and
  plain MathML formulas are supported.
  
  There is (per design choice) no support for the .fo context when a MathML
  document is referenced as an external graphic.
  
* Inline MathML Documents

  Inline MathML is supported through the \<fo:instream-foreign-object\> tag. The
  actual math content must use the "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" name
  space.
  
  MathML specified inline will take the following attributes from the
  surrounding .fo context:
  
  * Font size
  
  * Font color
  
  * Background color
  
  * Name of the fonts used. 
  
    Please note: The names of the fonts from the context are used to display the
    "normal" mathvariant. In the case of FOPs default, this uses a sans-serif
    font, whereas the MathML specification suggests to use a serif font. If you 
    wish to override this behavior, please specify a sans-serif font in the
    font-family for the instream-foreign-object.

Example Document

  An example document is available (in the JEuclid-fop distribution) in the 
  example/ sub-directory.
