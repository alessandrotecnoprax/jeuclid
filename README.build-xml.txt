The BUILD.XML file is autogenerated using the maven-ant-plugin.

Please use ant-build only if you are unable to install Maven. It is
supplied only for convenience purposes (Specifically Gentoo Linux
builds). It will not be modified or updated manually. The preferred
way to build this software is Maven http://maven.apache.org

Known Issues: The build file incorrectly tries to use ant's JUnit
plugin for the TestNG tests. This will not work. Do not run the tests,
or ensure that JUnit for ant is not installed
