<p>This package contains a subset of the DOM implementation, as
needed by JEuclid</p>
<p>There where two options for the internal DOM model:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Using an exsting implementation, such as Xerces</li>
	<li>Creating an own DOM implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>As most existing implementations add to the complexity and
increase the size a lot, the second choice was made</p>
<p>This has the disadvantage that not all standard DOM features are
implemented. If you find something that you really need, please submit a
patch for its implementation.</p>
